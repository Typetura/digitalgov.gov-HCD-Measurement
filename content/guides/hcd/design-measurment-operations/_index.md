Welcome to the HCD Measurement phase! The Measurement Concept and Operations Guides will help you determine how to leverage existing data to design and implement a measurement strategy. Its purpose is to help you understand how a product, service, or system *affects* the world, with the overall goal of understanding their overall *value* to the audience, agency, and federal space.

This is the concept guide. Like the other concept guides in the HCD series, the measurement concept guide focuses on “why” of measuring human-centered projects. It complements the methods and activities in the companion HCD Measurement Operations Guide. 

While the Operations Guide helps you to start measuring, this guide focuses on sharing more about what you need to know to measure things that are . We designed these two guides to speak to each other - you can start with either one or move between them as supports your needs.

At this point, you likely have solid user insight from your discovery phase that has informed the design, testing, and iteration of your program, service, or product. Throughout this Guide, we will refer to programs, products, services, and systems as *interventions*, for shorthand. We’ve decided to use the word “intervention” because anything that’s been designed by humans *intervenes* in the world; it changes the world in some way(s). Some of those changes we predict, desired or undesired, while others of them we do not predict. This is because all interventions outside of the controlled space of a lab encounter variables we do and do not know about. This is especially true in public sector design, where we frequently engage with wicked problems. 

## Expectations setting

The Measurement Guides make various assumptions in order to best serve the generalist user. For more on the audience for the Guide series, please see the Note to Audience section [link]. 

1. For the purposes of this measurement guide, **all situations under measurement consideration are assumed to be multi-dimensional, indirectly measurable, and human-centered.** If you need to build a set of key performance indicators to understand how an intervention functions, please reference the iteration section of the HCD Design guides [link]. 

   Multi-dimensional, indirectly measurable situations can be broadly thought of as experience measures**:** customer experience, digital experience, user experience, patient experience, et cetera. 

2. As in the other HCD Guides, **the method and approach to measurement in this guide is just one way to achieve your goal of understanding how your intervention is functioning in context.** In the same way the Design guides are not the exhaustive, definitive method of designing interventions, the Measurement guides are not the definitive, exclusive way to measure the effects of an intervention and to determine value. This is, however, a way to create a defensible, replicable, and balanced measurement and implementation strategy for your interventions. 

3. The purpose of these guides are not to make you an expert in data, evaluation, or social sciences. If you need to measure the impact of an intervention and you’re not sure how to start, this is the guide for you. Like the other guides in this series, the goal is to provide you with the ability to create documented results the logic and use of which can be extended and scaled if the intervention’s measurement context extends and scales. You might eventually need insight from scientific professionals, and this guide can help you know when to ask for that help. 

   Ideally of course, you would have access to formally trained Evaluation and/or Data Scientists and be guided by them in all things measurement. **This guide assumes that you do not have access to measurement experts**. This generalist’s guide can help you get some high-level measurements in place for your multidimensional interventions, and it can help you marshall your work in preparation to engage with professional Evaluators and Data Scientists, but it does not substitute for or gain the fidelity of measurement in those advanced practices. 

4. **Measuring the effects of interventions takes time.** Be aware that the amount of time measurement takes depends on how much data you already have at your fingertips and whether or not looking at that data in aggregate can help you understand the impact and value of your interventions. If you have robust, clean data sets available, you can assemble a compiled indicator within a few weeks. If you do not, you will likely need to circle back to the Discovery phase to find the data you need and create those data sets. In those cases, you should anticipate three to six months before you can confidently present an impact and/or value measurement. 

   

5. Ideally, you would plan for measurement long before launching your intervention. Sometimes you’re able to do that, and sometimes you’re not. **This guide assumes that you have not had the opportunity to plan ahead for measurement**, and that you will start building a measurement instrument to understand the effects of an intervention that’s already operating in the wider world. 

   You can also use this guide to build your measurement instrument before launching your intervention, but, since many users in our research inherit interventions instead of launching them independently, we have written it with the user who cannot enjoy the luxury, as they are the user with more extreme needs. 

   

## If you need it, orientation in the HCD phases 

### Discovery phase vs. Measurement phase

The Discovery phase focuses on research: asking questions, defining problem spaces, and gathering data to understand what’s happening in those spaces. In the Measurement phase, you should already have the data you need to understand impact at your fingertips. If you find that you do not have enough or the correct data to understand impact, if there are gaps in your data or in your understanding of how your intervention interacts in the world, then you need to circle back to the Discovery phase and gather data to plug those gaps. The [discovery concept](https://digital.gov/guides/hcd/discovery-concepts/) and [discovery operations](https://digital.gov/guides/hcd/discovery-operations/) guides can help you craft and execute those additional data-gathering activities. 

### Design phase vs. Measurement phase

Some readers of the HCD Guide series will want to understand the difference between measurement in the Design phase and measurement in the Measurement phase. 

In the design phase, you want to understand how an intervention functions. You test specific parts of an intervention in controlled circumstances, in order to iterate upon and improve upon each specific part of the designed thing. 

In this way, **design phase testing and iteration are self-referential** to the designed thing and its component parts. This includes testing that occurs in a pilot phase. Any time that the measurements you take refer to the mechanical functionality and/or the acceptance of your intervention in a defined audience, those are measurements as part of design. 

[TK illo 1.2]

In contrast, the measurement phase is wider in scope. The goal of this phase is to help you understand the impact of your intervention **in its real-world context**. That is, beyond your intended audience and in consideration of other interventions that yours interacts with. Instead of focusing on the intervention and learning about it through controlled tests, in the Measurement phase we’ll use a composite of datasets to make sense of how the designed thing functions in the real world, across time, and in contact **with variables we don’t control.** 

[TK illo 1.3]

Once you understand an intervention’s *effects* on the world, you will then be able to place that impact alongside the impacts of other interventions to understand their overall *value* to the audience, agency, and federal space.

Value is ongoing and evolves as time passes and pressures change. Your measurement strategy should be built to changes affect your designed things and its scope of impact. This might sound impossible or unsatisfying, but change and the ability to flex across change is a foundational part of a successful measurement strategy.
